## Introduction

The MERN Chat WebApp is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack. It allows users to create accounts, join chat rooms, and engage in conversations with other users in real-time. This project aims to demonstrate my proficiency in building full-stack web applications and utilizing modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used

The MERN Chat WebApp project utilizes the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user accounts, chat room data, and messages.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js framework used for building the backend API and handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library used for building the frontend user interface and components.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for running the server-side code and managing the backend logic.
- **Socket.IO**: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Used for structuring and styling the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular CSS framework used for responsive and visually appealing UI components.

## Features

The MERN Chat WebApp includes the following key features:

- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out to access the chat application.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Users can join chat rooms and engage in real-time conversations with other users.
- **User Presence**: Users can see the online/offline status of other users in the chat rooms.
- **Chat Room Creation**: Users can create new chat rooms and invite others to join.
- **Message History**: Users can view the history of messages in a chat room.

Feel free to explore the codebase for a detailed implementation of these features.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-chat-webapp.git`.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory and install the dependencies for the frontend and backend separately using `npm install`.
3. Create a MongoDB database and configure the connection string in the backend `.env` file.
4. Start the backend server using `npm run start` in the backend directory.
5. Start the frontend development server using `npm start` in the frontend directory.
6. Access the chat application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

Please note that additional configuration steps or environment variable setup may be required based on your specific setup or deployment environment.
